TuxBlocks is a game and tool for helping students visualize algebra in a new way.
TuxBlocks was created by Thomas Price under the mentorship of Aaditya Maheshwari for Tux4Kids, an open-source group which develops high-quality software for kids, with the goal of combining fun and learning into an irresistible package.
